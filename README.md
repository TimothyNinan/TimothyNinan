### Showcase

**Buzz Market**
[Github](https://github.com/TimothyNinan/Buzz-Market)
- Engineered a community-focused marketplace with a React and Bootstrap responsive UI serving user and listing data from GCP via a Flask powered REST API 
- Implemented pytest for backend unit testing and Cypress for frontend integration testing, achieving 90% code coverage and detecting 20+ critical bugs before production
- Automated end-to-end testing with Selenium, validating critical user interactions such as login, search, filtering, and watchlist management reducing manual QA time by 60%
- Built a real-time messaging system with JavaScript and Firebase, enabling 1-on-1 chats (<200ms latency), securing communications with JWT authentication and Flask-CORS to prevent unauthorized access

**Smart Camera Parking System**
[Github](https://github.com/TimothyNinan/SCPS)
- Designed firmware for a microcontroller-based automated entry and exit management using real-time camera data
- Trained a JavaScript TensorFlow model for license plate localization and integrated PaddleOCR in Python to achieve 95% recognition accuracy and decreased total processing time by 48%
- Composed and Presented formal project proposal with GANTT and PERT charts securing $500+ in funding

**Location Search Application**
[Github](https://github.com/TimothyNinan/Location-Search)
- Led a 5-member Agile team to build a React frontend deployed on Google App Engine with OAuth authentication, location-based pin drop, filtering, and sorting features
- Architected a Model-View-Controller pattern in Java Spring Boot backend to implement Google Search API processing, then developed JUnit tests to achieve 81% test coverage
